<p>OASIS TC GitHub repositories, as described in <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/tcadmin/github-repositories-for-oasis-tc-members-chartered-work">GitHub Repositories for OASIS TC Members' Chartered Work</a>, are governed by the OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/tc-process">TC Process</a>, <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/ipr">IPR Policy</a>, and other policies, similar to TC Wikis, TC JIRA issues tracking instances, TC SVN/Subversion repositories, etc.  While they make use of public GitHub repositories, these TC GitHub repositories are distinct from <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories">OASIS TC Open Repositories</a>, which are used for development of open source <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/licenses">licensed</a> content.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The purpose of this GitHub repository is to support development of proposals and change tracking for the OpenC2 Language Specification as new working draft level revisions are created and the associated CSDs mature.</p>

<p>This repository is designed to support TC members' work on a formal specification that describes the OpenC2 language. The Work Product title is "Open Command and Control (OpenC2) Language Specification Version 1.0". The authoritative format for the specification is Markdown, as per the OpenC2 TC <a href="https://issues.oasis-open.org/browse/TCADMIN-3011">request form</a>.</p>


This repository is organized with three branches:

 * The *_Working_* branch contains work product 
 material that is actively being developed, and 
 subject to potentially frequent and significant 
 change. Contributors to the work product should 
 target their inputs to the Working branch.

 * The *_Releases_* branch contains incremental 
 releases (i.e., Working Drafts [WDs]) of the work 
 product. The current contents of the Working 
 branch are merged into the Releases branch to 
 create a WD. 

 * The *_Master_* branch contains TC-approved 
[Committee Specification](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dCommitteeSpec) (CS) or [OASIS Standard](https://www.oasis-open.org/policies-guidelines/oasis-defined-terms-2018-05-22#dOASISstandard) 
versions of the work product. Until the first CS 
is approved, the Master branch will not contain 
a complete version of the work product.
<h4>Committee Specification, v1.0</h4>

<p>The OpenC2 TC approved v1.0 of the Language Specification as an OASIS Committee Specification on 11 July 2019. The OASIS <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/news/announcements/three-committee-specifications-approved-by-open-command-and-control-openc2-tc">publication announcement</a> was made on 5 August 2019. The master branch of this repository contains copies of the files published by OASIS and linked to that announcement; these copies are captured here for convenience and the versions on the OASIS website are the official, authoritative versions of the specification.</p>

<h3>Further Description of this Repository</h3>

<p>Open Command and Control (OpenC2) is a concise and extensible language to enable the command and control of cyber defense components, subsystems and/or systems in a manner that is agnostic of the underlying products, technologies, transport mechanisms, or other aspects of the implementation. The <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/openc2/oc2ls/">OpenC2 Language Specification</a> defines the OpenC2 language, and the responsibility for drafting it resides with the <a href="https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=openc2-lang">OASIS OpenC2 Language Subcommittee (LSC)</a>.</p>
